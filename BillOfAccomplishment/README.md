# Bill of Accomplishment

Over the course of the past eight weeks I have learned a great deal about the C# programming language. The course provided textbook and labs were helpful, however I found that coding websites ([sanfoundry](https://www.sanfoundry.com/), [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/), etc.), Youtube videos ([derek babans](https://www.youtube.com/user/derekbanas), etc) and other 
books ([cracking the coding interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850), [c# in a nutshell](https://www.amazon.com/C-7-0-Nutshell-Definitive-Reference/dp/1491987650), etc.) greatly increased my understanding of the subject.

I have complied a portfolio of 50 programs the give a broad representation of what I have studied and learned from. Some of my favorites are the [EightQueensProblem](https://github.com/JamesHiegel/CSharp_Portfolio/tree/master/EightQueensProblem), [MergeSort](https://github.com/JamesHiegel/CSharp_Portfolio/tree/master/MergeSort), [Decorator](https://github.com/JamesHiegel/CSharp_Portfolio/tree/master/Decorator) and [QueueAsLinkedList](https://github.com/JamesHiegel/CSharp_Portfolio/tree/master/QueueAsLinkedList).

I was able to expanded my knowledge of using GitHub to host my programs and how to keep repositories synchronized between devices. I was able to push my commits from home and then pull them at school. Additionally, I learned how to use [themes](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-jekyll-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-with-the-jekyll-theme-chooser) and [markup code](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) in GitHub to make my repos and README.md files look like websites.

I believe that I should receive an A for this class due to my efforts at not just learning how to write basic C# programs, but more advanced topics and developmer tools. I also freely shared my knowledge and learning with my classmates and learned from them as well.
