#Bill of Accomplishment

Over the course of the past eight weeks I have learned a great deal about the C# programming 
language. The course provided textbook and labs were helpful, however I found that coding 
websites (sanfoundry, geeksforgeeks, etc.), Youtube videos (derek babans, etc) and other 
books (cracking the coding interview, c# in a nutshell, etc.) greatly increased my 
understanding of the subject.

I have complied a portfolio of 50 programs the give a broad representation of what I have 
studied and learned from. Some of my favorites are the EightQueensProblem, MergeSort, 
Decorator and QueueAsLinkedList.

I was able to expanded my knowledge of using GitHub to host my programs and how to keep repositories 
synchronized between devices. I was able to push my commits from home and then pull them at school.
Additionally, I learned how to use themes and markup code in GitHub to make my repos and README.md
files look like websites.

I believe that I should receive an A for this class due to my efforts at not just learning how to 
write basic C# programs, but more advanced topics and developmer tools. I also freely shared my 
knowledge and learning with my classmates and learned from them as well.
