# C# Portfolio

This repository contains annotated and rewritten C# programs that demonstrate my understanding of C#.

## Getting Started

Each program is located in its own folder, if I have rewritten the program the original version is saved as "\_orig.cs". Source code can be viewed in the web browser or your favorite editor.

If you are using Visual Studio each program folder is saved as a seperate project and the repository is saved as a solution.
